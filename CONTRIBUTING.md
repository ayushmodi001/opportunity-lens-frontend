## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/your-username/opportunity-lens-frontend/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/your-username/opportunity-lens-frontend/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue to start a discussion about your idea. This is the best way to get feedback before you start working on something.
- Clearly describe the enhancement, why it's needed, and provide examples of how it would work.

## Development Setup

Ready to contribute? Hereâ€™s how to set up `opportunity-lens-frontend` for local development.

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/opportunity-lens-frontend.git
    ```
3.  **Navigate** to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd opportunity-lens-frontend
    ```
4.  **Install** the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
5.  **Set up** your local environment variables. Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add the necessary variables (e.g., `MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_STRING`, `AUTH_SECRET`). You can use `.env.example` as a template if one exists.
6.  **Run** the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Create a new branch from `main` for your feature or bug fix:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-amazing-feature
    ```
2.  Make your changes and commit them with a descriptive message. We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Add amazing new feature"
    ```
3.  Push your branch to your forked repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-amazing-feature
    ```
4.  Open a **Pull Request** to the `main` branch of the original repository.
5.  Provide a clear title and description for your pull request, linking to any relevant issues.
6.  Ensure your code lints and passes any automated checks.
